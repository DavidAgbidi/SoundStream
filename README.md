3. **Manage Availability**: Toggle track active/inactive status
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track streams and earnings in real-time

### For Collaborations
1. **Create Collaboration**: Use `register-collaboration-track` with all collaborators
2. **Define Splits**: Set royalty percentages that sum to 100%
3. **Add Members**: Add new collaborators to existing tracks
4. **Shared Control**: Collaborators can update pricing and manage tracks

### For Listeners
1. **Discover Tracks**: Browse available tracks by ID
2. **Stream Music**: Pay artists directly via `stream-track`
